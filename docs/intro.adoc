== Intro

This project is a proof of concept to evaluate how
http://groovy-lang.org/[`Groovy`] can create a full-stack application
using http://grails.org[`Grails`] framework for the back-end, in the
front-end with an http://android.com[`Android`] app and Gradle as the
building tool to build them all.

I'll be writing about all the different parts of the application,
which libraries I've used, techniques I put in practice, problems I
had in the way...etc.

I hope this will be helping not only me but others using the same
technology.
